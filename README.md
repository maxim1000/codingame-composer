# codingame-composer
Codingame requires program to be in single file which is inconvenient.

This program composes all files into one and places the result into clipboard.

* Works for C++.
* #include for local files should use quotes, for standard - angle brackets.
* All files should be in directory ../bot relative to the current directory of this program.
* Only h and cpp files are processed.
* Windows-only
